My current project will involve building a replica of the google homepage using resources from the internet. Also the second assignment is to rebuild or replicate the search results page.

20:24pm: Still working on the google homepage project. Ive got the logo, buttons and search bar centered but not aligned, and im not sure if its the correct way of getting things to center and moving them around but at the this point i just want to get it done and then i can see what code is wrong and go from there. I also have the nav bar top and bottom and inlined. So far my progres has been pretty good. Im learning alot and coming further than i thought i would AND im still enjoying it with is a bonus. Might do some more later tonight but im hungry and tired. So for now this is enough study.
