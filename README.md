My current project will involve building a replica of the google homepage using resources from the internet. Also the second assignment is to rebuild or replicate the search results page.

20:24pm: Still working on the google homepage project. Ive got the logo, buttons and search bar centered but not aligned, and im not sure if its the correct way of getting things to center and moving them around but at the this point i just want to get it done and then i can see what code is wrong and go from there. I also have the nav bar top and bottom and inlined. So far my progres has been pretty good. Im learning alot and coming further than i thought i would AND im still enjoying it with is a bonus. Might do some more later tonight but im hungry and tired. So for now this is enough study.

10:00am: Taking a break, but i finished the buttons, search bar and google logo to almost match the home screen of google. Slowly getting there, i did most of it on my own, a few color options and radius options i took from the google homepage dev tools, but other than that i figured out all the spacing and centering and what not. hopefully its up to standard. Just gotta work on the top nav bar and bottom nav bar, they are already in the top and bottom positions but i still need to space them and all that. So after lunch i will continue with that, and once its done i can continue on with the odin project and dive into java!
